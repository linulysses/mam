# Manifold Additive Models

Provided in mam.R is the implementation of the manifold additive model proposed in the paper [Additive models for symmetric positive-definite matrices and Lie groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08789); a demo is given in demo.R.

The ADNI data cannot be made public here; methods to obtain and preprocess data are provided [here](https://github.com/linulysses/iRFDA-sparse).
